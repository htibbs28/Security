Penetration Testing Phases:
1. Mission Definition
  Define goals, targets
  Determine mission scope
  Define RoE
2. Recon
  Gather info (Active or Passive)
3. Footprinting
4. Exploitation
5. Post-Exploitation
6. Documentation

Reporting:
Opnotes - Technical details
Formalized Report - Technical or Executive

Why a report?
Continuity
Accounting of Actions
Ability to repeat Actions
Troubleshoot issues

What to Include:
Tools
Timestamps
Success/Failure
Analytic Conclusions
Unexpected Results

Exploit Research:
Initial Access - first foothold on the network
  Phishing is the most common method used to gain initial access
  Other methods include watering hole attacks and credential reuse
Exploitation Research - Transition to recon to weaponization
Research - OSINT 
Capablties - Mission Objectives drive requirements
  Collection and Effects
  Additional Functionality
  COMSEC
Testing - Verify Success
  Faster time to break out of initial foothold
  Reduced risk of detection or tool failure
  Inproved recovery times
Plan - Procure software and hardware
  Assign developer and tester
  Document results
Important Websites:
  cve.mitre.org
  exploit-db.com
  
Scanning and Recon:
OSINT - specific intelligence requirement
HTML - Markup language for browser interpretation of webpages
